    <p>Hi I'm Vinny Garcia,I'm a sophmore at West High School. I play DekHockey, I hangout with friends. I'm nice, I also get along with people very easily. In my spare time I do a lot of things.</p>
    <p>I actually lied I don't do much but what I do is watch Youtube for a couple mins then I play football with some friends. Then i'll get on my Playstation and then sleep.</p>
